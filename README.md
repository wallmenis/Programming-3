# Programming 3 assignments
The assignments that I solved whilst on the Programming 3 class. They involve various bash and unix IPC exercises. Feel free to read the code. A lot of the comments are in greek (because the class is in greek... duh!). I will make comment translations on demand if anyone needs/wants to have them.
